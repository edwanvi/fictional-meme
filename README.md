(Better known as Test Mod Please Ignore.)

This repository contains the source code for [this mod.](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/test-mod-please-ignore) It's actually not that bad.

This mod requires Minecraft Forge to run, like every other mod these days. It runs on Minecraft 1.11 (with no current intentions of backporting.)
